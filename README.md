# Kitsune

Kitsune is a lightweight microservice-oriented framework designed to simplify the development and deployment of microservices across different cloud providers. Its goal is to provide developers with an intuitive and flexible toolkit to build scalable and resilient applications.

**Note:** This README.md file is a template to help you get started. Feel free to modify it to suit your project's needs.

## Features

- **Microservice Architecture**: Kitsune follows a microservice architectural pattern, enabling you to break down your application into small, independent services.
- **Cloud Provider Agnostic**: Kitsune is designed to work seamlessly across different cloud providers, allowing you to deploy your microservices everywhere.
- **Easy Deployment**: Kitsune provides simple and straightforward deployment options, reducing the complexity of managing and scaling your microservices.
- **Scalability and Resilience**: Built-in features in Kitsune enable scalability and resilience, ensuring your microservices can handle high loads and recover from failures.
- **Multiple Protocol Support**: Kitsune use HTTP and gRPC protocols for high performance.

### Usage

To use Kitsune, follow these steps:
<!--
1. Define your microservices: Create individual services within the `services` directory. Each service should be self-contained with its own logic and dependencies.
2. Configure service discovery: Kitsune includes a service discovery mechanism to enable communication between microservices. Ensure you have a service discovery mechanism set up, such as Consul or etcd.
3. Define service endpoints: Specify the endpoints for each microservice within the `services` directory, allowing other services to access their functionalities.
4. Build Docker images: Use the provided Dockerfile to build Docker images for each microservice: `docker build -t service-name .`
5. Deploy microservices: Deploy the built Docker images to your preferred cloud provider, leveraging their container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run).
